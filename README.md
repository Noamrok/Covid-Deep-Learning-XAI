# An Explainable Machine Learning Model for Predicting the Severity Level of COVID-19 Diagnosed Patient

I conducted an academic research, as part of my final degree project, on the capability of Deep Neural Networks to predict the connection between underlying medical conditions and Covid-19â€™s severity level. 
Deep neural networks were implemented with Keras API and their predicitons were explained using LIME.

Because medical records are classified, I took the dataset from Mexico.
The dataset was baised and incomplete.
There are two models: one with three severity levels and one with two severity levels.

These are the DNNs:
